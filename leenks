1. Have a training set of tests
2. Extract features from the training set RPMs
3. Run each of the agents for each problem in the training set
4. Collect results
5. Create a table of features of each RPM and which agent solved it best.

The table in step 5 will be the result of training of the meta-agent with the training set

Once the new problems are received:
1. Extract the features of each problem
2. Compare with the feature set in the table and select the feature which matches closest with the new problem feature
3. Get the agent which performed the best for that feature set
4. Run that agent.
